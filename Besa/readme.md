#Coptic models for ocropy
These models where generated from a HCR (human character recognition) ground truth. The whole work was presented at the poster session at Datech 2017.
The number coptic_model-*00001000*.pyrnn.gz represents the amount iterations, in general models with a higher number should be more accurate. Choose models with at least 10000 iterations for OCR tasks. Even if the change of accuracy is marginal try out multiple models with different iterations.
